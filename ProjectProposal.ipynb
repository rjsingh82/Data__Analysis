    "Disease is something that has affected all of us either personally or to people close to us. One of the biggest weaknesses of the current disease diagnostic system is that not enough emphasis is put on preventing illnesses. Often times diseases are treatable, but aren’t treated soon enough and thus become uncontrollable. In a data-driven world, we want to utilize what we are learning in this class to give healthcare professionals an additional way to detect and better treat certain diseases. If we can prove that there are correlations between socioeconomic statuses and certain diseases, this will allow doctors to target certain regions to catch more cases of the diseases early on. \n",
    "Similar work has been done in trying to understand the relationship between certain diseases and how it is dealt with in poverty-stricken areas. One particular study done in 2015 looked at Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, a notable “poverty-associated” diseases, and how it controlled among patients of different socioeconomic statuses. The study gathered its data by working with the patients at a dermatology clinic at Imam Reza Hospital. The patients were classified as low, medium, or high socioeconomic status and then received treatment for the disease for the following year. It was concluded that a year later, poverty did in fact seem to prolong the course of the disease. \n",
    "Another study looked at the relationship between socioeconomic status and the presence of cardiovascular diseases in a retirement community in Shanghai. Factors like educational level, marital status, annual income, and so on were taken into account. Using a logistical regression model, it was seen if socioeconomic factors were in any way correlated to increase chances of heart issues. However, the conclusion for this study was that there was no direct correlation between the two and that different socioeconomic groups would have different intervention plans because each group exhibited different risks.\n",

Another thing we need to take into consideration is the large amount of data in our cities data set and specifically look at just the 2014 data in order to match it with our zip code data set.

    "   There are a lot of biases and pitfalls to keep an eye out for in our data. The first bias we will have to watch out for is the ‘confirmation bias’, or our team’s personal desire to try and prove our hypothesis to be correct. In a situation where you have so much freedom over how to clean and analyze the given dataset, we may aspire to try and draw conclusions that support our initial postulate. Outliers can also have a significant effect on how we interpret our data’s average and range, but this can be mitigated if we carefully clean out all the ‘bad’ data using methods mentioned in the ‘Proposed Methods’ section. However, you have to be careful to distinguish whether those outliers are actually bad cases or valid extreme data because you may have occurrences of diseases in seemingly random situations. In the case of our data, we may encounter ‘Simpson’s Paradox’: the theory that a trend in different groups of data disappears or even reverses when the groups of data are combined. This is particularly important in our case because we are looking at diseases not only from a geographic standpoint, but also from a socioeconomic perspective. Once we do the analysis and identify trends in each of these groups of data we may attempt to draw further conclusions by combining the two sets, during which there is a very real possibility that the correlations we saw no longer hold true. Throughout all of our analysis, we as data scientists, must be especially cognizant of ‘overfitting’ or ‘underfitting’ the data we have. We want to draw accurate conclusions, but we must recognize that this is a tremendously large amount of data (disease statistics from over 500 major cities in America). We have to be careful not to get too caught up in every little detail and focus on maintaining a broader scope. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   If our hypothesis is not proven the way we would have hoped, we will continue to diligently analyze the data in hopes of finding some other correlation that we may not have considered. One of the big reasons we are looking at diseases is that there definitely have been established patterns in the past research we have looked at. Most diseases originate from some unhealthy human behavior and thus we may spend time looking at some of the other parameters of the dataset that we may have initially ignored. However, if even looking at our data in a different light doesn’t yield any results, then we will report the results that we found, explain what we felt went wrong with our proposition, and provide any additional information that we believe is of use. As for the proposed methods going wrong, that is a bit easier of a problem to fix. We can simply change what methods we are using if we feel that the ones we initially thought were going to be good don’t pan out the way we would have hoped. For example, we may go back and change age range or bring back variables we thought weren’t important. A large part of this analysis we will be doing is adapting to the results we get and trying to formulate the most meaningful conclusions possible. Our ultimate goal for this assignment is to be able to provide doctors and healthcare professionals with correlations they may not have considered so we will strive to do that in any way possible."
